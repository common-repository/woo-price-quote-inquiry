This plugin is designed to assist administrators who want to hide product purchase details. Once activated, users will no longer be able to view these details. However, they will still have the option to send an inquiry about the product.

If a user wants to purchase a product that has a quoted price, they can fill out an inquiry form on the product page. The product author will receive an email with the inquiry and will respond to the customer accordingly.
